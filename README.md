# Channel Coding
Coursework for 2017 Channel Coding lecture in SYSU taught by Professor Li Chen.
## Overview
The task of the coursework is to implement the convolutional code with three decoding algorithms including hard-decision Viterbi, soft-decision Viterbi and BCJR in C++.
## Results
The BER performance of (7,5)<sub>8</sub> convolutional code over AWGN channel using BPSK modulation
